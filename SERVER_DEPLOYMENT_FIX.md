# Fix for npm install Error on Server

The error you're encountering is due to a dependency conflict between `react-leaflet@5.0.0` and the React version. Here's how to resolve it:

## Problem Analysis
- `react-leaflet@5.0.0` requires React `^19.0.0`
- Your server has React `18.3.1` installed, causing a conflict
- The `package.json` has been updated to use React `^19.1.0` to resolve this

## Immediate Fix on Server

Run npm install with the legacy peer deps flag:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will allow the installation to proceed despite the peer dependency conflict.

## Permanent Solution

Update your `package.json` on the server to match the corrected version:

1. **Edit package.json** on the server:
```bash
nano package.json
```

2. **Ensure React and React-DOM versions** are set to:
```json
"react": "^19.1.0",
"react-dom": "^19.1.0",
```

3. **Remove node_modules and package-lock.json** to clean install:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

4. **Reinstall dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

## Alternative: Use npm force

If the above doesn't work, you can force the installation:

```bash
npm install --force
```

## Verification

After installation, verify the React version:

```bash
npm list react
```

This should show `react@19.1.0` or similar.

## Additional Notes

- The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is safe for this scenario as React 19 is largely backward compatible with React 18
- Ensure your code doesn't use any deprecated React 18 features that might not work in React 19
- The build should work fine with React 19 as the application was tested with this version

If you continue to experience issues, consider deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file and running `npm install` again with the updated `package.json`.
